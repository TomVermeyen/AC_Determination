# AC_Determination
The files present in this project are meant for reproducing some figures from the article 'Exploring machine learning methods for absolute configuration determination with vibrational circular dichroism' (10.1039/D1CP02428K).
The files are structured as such:
  SX_Ycm.csv contain the feature importances for spectra of theoretical level SX with a sampling interval of Ycm.
  3D PCA and 2D t-SNE transformed spectra can be found in the appropiate files.
  
Theoretical levels abbreviations used:
* S1 b3lyp/6-31g(d)
* S2 b3pw91/6-31g(d)
* S3 b3lyp/6-31g++(d,p)
* S4 b3pw91/6-31g++(d,p)
* S5 b3lyp/6-311++g(2d,2p)
* S6 b3pw91/6-311++g(2d,2p)
